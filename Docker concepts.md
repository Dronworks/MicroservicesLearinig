# Concepts
* Docker only run when there is a process, hence running ubunty will end right after it starts, because no process is there.
* There is a possibility to run a command inside docker for example: **docker run ubuntu sleep 5** will sleep and stop container.
* **docker run** will run on front and will lock the terminal, add **-d** to run in background.
* hub.docker.com/explore - docker images.
